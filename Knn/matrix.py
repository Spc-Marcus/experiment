def impute_missing_values(matrix: np.ndarray, n_neighbors: int = 10) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Impute missing values in a genomic variant matrix using K-Nearest Neighbors.
    
    This function fills missing or uncertain values in a variant matrix by leveraging
    patterns from similar reads. It uses the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to identify
    reads with similar variant patterns and imputes missing values based on the
    consensus of these neighbors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    matrix : np.ndarray
        Input matrix with shape (n_reads, n_positions) containing variant calls.
        Values can include:
        - 1: Reference allele or major variant
        - 0: Alternative allele or minor variant  
        - np.nan: Missing or uncertain values to be imputed
        - Other numerical values: Intermediate probabilities or quality scores
        
        Missing values (np.nan, None) will be replaced with estimated values
        based on K nearest neighbors.
        
    n_neighbors : int, optional
        Number of nearest neighbors to use for imputation. Must be positive
        and less than the number of reads with complete data.
        Default is 10.
        
    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Matrix with same shape as input but with missing values imputed.
        All np.nan values will be replaced with estimated values based on
        the K-nearest neighbors algorithm. Original non-missing values are
        preserved unchanged.
        
        **Value range**: Imputed values will be in the range of existing
        non-missing values in the dataset (typically 0-1 for binary variants).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If n_neighbors is not positive or exceeds the number of complete reads
    MemoryError
        If matrix is too large for available system memory
    RuntimeError
        If imputation fails due to insufficient non-missing data
