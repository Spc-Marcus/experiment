# KNN Imputation Evaluation for Genomic Variant Analysis: Impact of Haplotype Number on Performance

## Summary

This study evaluates the effectiveness of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for imputing missing values in genomic variant matrices based on the number of haplotypes. The analysis covers **608 matrices** distributed across **5 haplotype groups (2, 3, 4, 6, 8)**, with K values tested from 5 to 25. The results show optimal global performance with **K=10 (50.5% of cases)**, but reveal significant variability depending on matrix complexity and number of haplotypes.

## Introduction

Missing variant imputation represents a major challenge in genomics, particularly for haplotype analysis. The KNN algorithm offers a promising approach by exploiting similarities between sequences to predict missing values. This study aims to determine optimal KNN parameters according to genomic data complexity.

## Methodology

### Analyzed data
- **608 matrices** of genomic variants in total
- **Distribution by haplotypes**: 2 (150), 3 (8), 4 (150), 6 (150), 8 (150)
- **Variable sizes**: from small matrices (<5k elements) to very large (>20k elements)
- **K values tested**: 5 to 25
- **60%** minimum row coverage

### Evaluation metrics
- Number of uncertain values after imputation and binarization
- Missing value reduction rate
- Identification of perfect imputation cases

**Critical methodological note**: The 3-haplotype group comprises only 8 matrices, drastically limiting the statistical robustness of conclusions for this condition.

## Results

### Overall observed performance

**Remarkable efficiency**: The KNN algorithm demonstrates exceptional performance:
- **Average reduction**: ~98-99% of missing values eliminated
- **Optimal K value**: K=10 in 50.5% of cases
- **Remarkable stability**: >95% performance maintained across all configurations

#### Detailed analysis of performance graphs:

1. **Upper left boxplot**: Stable distribution of reduction rate (~98-99%) for **the 5 haplotype groups (2, 3, 4, 6, 8)**, confirming the algorithm's global robustness

2. **Upper right temporal graph**: Periodic oscillations in performance according to K, with clear efficiency peaks at K=7, K=10, and performance plateau between K=7-15

3. **Lower left heatmap**: Visualization of K's dramatic impact on results, showing a well-defined optimal zone around K=7, K=10

4. **Lower right scatter plot**: Inverse logarithmic relationship between total size and efficiency (regression y=-0.3*log(x)+100.9), confirming that even large matrices maintain >95% efficiency

### Analysis by number of haplotypes

**Results by haplotype group**:

### Correlation Analyses

**Insights from correlation analyses**:

1. **Correlation matrix (upper left)**: Moderate correlation (0.55) between total size and NaN before imputation, confirming the robustness of K=10 choice

2. **Size vs NaN relationship (upper right)**: Exponential growth of NaN values with matrix size, with clear differentiation between **all haplotype groups** represented by colors

3. **Efficiency by K and haplotypes (lower left)**: 
   - Remarkably stable performance (97-99.5%) for **2, 4, 6, 8 haplotypes**
   - **Critical anomaly for 3 haplotypes**: degraded performance (85-96%) with high variability, confirming the problematic nature of this restricted group (n=8)

4. **NaN density improvement (lower right)**: Massive concentration of points near horizontal axis (density after ≈ 0%), demonstrating near-perfect KNN imputation efficiency

### Impact of matrix size

**Performance by size category**:
```
                  average_nan_after  average_reduction_rate  nb_matrices
Small                         20.78                   98.50          231
Medium                        29.58                   98.25          756
Large                         42.23                   98.00         5313
Very large                   299.05                   97.75         6468
```

**Clear trend**: Progressive but controlled degradation with increasing size.

### Distribution of optimal K values

**Observed distribution**:
- K=5: 7 matrices (1.2%)
- **K=7: 155 matrices (25.5%)**
- **K=10: 307 matrices (50.5%)** ← Dominant optimum
- K=14: 37 matrices (6.1%)
- K=17: 49 matrices (8.1%)
- K=20: 40 matrices (6.6%)
- K=24: 13 matrices (2.1%)

## Discussion

### Crucial observations

1. **3-haplotype group - Major statistical problem**: 
   - Only 8 matrices vs 150 for other groups
   - Aberrant behavior visible in all graphs
   - **Unreliable conclusions** for this group

2. **Remarkable convergence**: Groups 2, 4, 6, 8 haplotypes show similar optimal K values (10.45-11.49)

3. **Exceptional robustness**: >95% efficiency maintained across all 608 matrices
