# Analysis Report: ILP Haplotype Algorithm Performance

## Executive Summary

The performance analysis of the ILP algorithm on 4,128 data matrices reveals an **overall efficiency rate of 74.3%**, meaning that the majority of problems are solved without resorting to costly ILP optimization.

**Major finding**: A comparative study on 1,057 common instances shows that **using a seed significantly degrades performance**, with execution times increasing by **83%** on average (2.24s vs 4.11s).

## Methodology

### Analyzed data
- **4,128 matrices** of genomic variants in total
- **Distribution by haplotypes**: 2 (1,028), 3 (8), 4 (1,057), 6 (906), 8 (1,129)
- **Variable sizes**: from small matrices (<10K elements) to very large ones (>250K elements)
- **Matrix densities**: from 0.6 to 1.0 (binary matrices)
- **Algorithm parameters**: error threshold 0.025, minimum number of rows/columns per cluster 5/3
- **60%** threshold for cols

### Seed vs No-Seed Comparison
- **1,057 common instances** tested with both configurations
- **Time limit**: 10 minutes per instance (Gurobi)
- **Strong correlation** (0.728) between both approaches confirming result consistency

### Evaluation metrics
- **Total ILP calls** (`ilp_calls_total`): number of optimization resolutions required
- **Execution time**: total time, preprocessing time, clustering time
- **Algorithmic efficiency**: percentage of resolution without resorting to ILP
- **Structural complexity**: size × density, number of detected patterns
- **Performance by region**: number of regions processed, average region size

### Run classification
- **Efficient runs (3,069)**: 0 ILP calls (resolution by hierarchical clustering alone)
- **Complex runs (1,059)**: ≥1 ILP call (requiring Gurobi optimization)

### Calculation mechanism
The number of ILP calls (`ilp_calls_total`) counts **each time the algorithm must solve an optimization sub-problem**:

1. **Preprocessing** → Identification of problematic regions
2. **For each region** → Attempt at simple clustering
3. **If failure** → Call to `find_quasi_biclique()` with Gurobi optimization
4. **Counting**: +1 for each successful ILP resolution

```
0 ILP calls = Efficient algorithm (resolution by simple clustering)
>0 ILP calls = Complex matrix requiring optimization
```

**Critical methodological note**: The 3-haplotype group comprises only 8 matrices, drastically limiting the statistical robustness of conclusions for this condition. The analysis focuses primarily on groups 2, 4, 6, and 8 haplotypes representing 4,120 reliable matrices.

## Seed Impact Analysis

### Performance Comparison Results

| Metric | No Seed | With Seed | Impact |
|--------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Mean execution time** | 2.24s | 4.11s | **+83% slower** |
| **Median execution time** | 1.49s | 2.53s | **+70% slower** |
| **Mean ILP calls** | 8.6 | 10.4 | **+21% more calls** |
| **Maximum time** | 22.17s | 53.78s | **+143% worst case** |

### Key Findings
1. **Seed degrades performance** across all haplotype counts (2, 4, 6, 8)
2. **Consistent degradation pattern**: More complex instances (higher haplotype count) show greater performance penalty
3. **Strong correlation (0.728)** confirms both approaches solve the same problems with consistent relative difficulty
4. **Counter-intuitive result**: Expected seed to improve determinism and potentially performance, but opposite observed

### Haplotype-Specific Impact
- **2 haplotypes**: +67% execution time with seed
- **4 haplotypes**: +96% execution time with seed  
- **6 haplotypes**: +84% execution time with seed
- **8 haplotypes**: +85% execution time with seed

## Graph Analysis

### 1. Efficiency Rate by Number of Haplotypes
![Efficiency Rate by Haplotype](plots/efficiency_rate_by_haplotype.png)

The graph shows a **progressive degradation** of efficiency with increasing number of haplotypes:

**Key observations:**
- **Haplotypes 2-3**: Near-perfect efficiency (99.6% and 100%)
- **Haplotype 4**: Slight decrease (92.1%) but still excellent
- **Haplotype 6**: Significant drop (55.3%)
- **Haplotype 8**: Reduced efficiency (49.9%)

**Interpretation:** The more haplotypes increase, the more structural complexity grows exponentially, forcing the algorithm to resort to ILP optimization.

### 2. ILP Calls Distribution
![ILP Calls Distribution](plots/ilp_calls_distribution.png)

The graph reveals a **very positive distribution**:

**Observed breakdown:**
- **~74% of cases (3,069 runs)**: 0 ILP calls (direct resolution by clustering)
- **~20% of cases**: 1-24 ILP calls (moderate complexity)
- **~6% of cases**: >25 ILP calls (very complex cases)

**Significance:** The overwhelming majority of matrices are processed efficiently without costly optimization.

### 3. Execution Time vs Matrix Size
![Execution Time vs Matrix Size](plots/time_vs_size_all_data.png)

The graph shows a **clear correlation** between size and complexity:

**Observed trends:**
- **Small matrices** (<50K): Constant times, very fast
- **Medium matrices** (50-100K): Moderate dispersion
- **Large matrices** (>100K): Some complex cases with high times
- **Clear differentiation** between efficient points (low) and complex ones (scattered)

### 4. Multi-Factor Efficiency Analysis
![Efficiency Analysis](plots/efficiency_analysis.png)

The 4 sub-graphs reveal the **critical factors** of efficiency:

**Matrix size:**
- **Critical threshold**: Around 50,000 elements
- **Drastic drop** in efficiency beyond 100,000 elements

**Matrix density:**
- **Optimum**: Density >0.9 (near-perfect efficiency)
- **Critical zone**: Density 0.7-0.8 (efficiency ~50%)

**Complexity** (size × density):
- Direct correlation: the more complexity increases, the more ILP calls are necessary

### 5. Efficient vs Complex Runs Comparison
![Complex vs Efficient Runs](plots/complex_vs_efficient_comparison.png)

The comparison graph shows two **distinct populations**:

**Efficient runs (3,069 cases):**
- Constant and very low execution time
- Generally smaller matrices
- Concentration on simple haplotypes
- **74.3% of total runs**

**Complex runs (1,059 cases):**
- Significant dispersion of execution times
- Strong size-time correlation
- Predominance of complex haplotypes (6-8)
- **25.7% of total runs**

### 6. Seed vs No-Seed Comparison
![ILP Computation Time Comparison](ilp_comparison_dashboard.png)

The comprehensive comparison reveals:

**Time distribution:** Boxplots show consistently higher execution times with seed across all instances

**Matrix density impact:** Performance degradation with seed is consistent across different matrix densities (0.65-0.95)

**Direct correlation:** Strong linear relationship (0.728) confirms both methods tackle identical problem difficulty but with different efficiency

**ILP calls pattern:** Seed approach requires more ILP solver calls, explaining increased computation time

2. **Alternative randomization**: Test different seed strategies
3. **Hybrid approach**: Conditional seed usage based on instance complexity
